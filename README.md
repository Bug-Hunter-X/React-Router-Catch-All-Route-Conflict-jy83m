# React Router Catch-All Route Conflict

This repository demonstrates a common issue with React Router's catch-all route (`*`) when it conflicts with other defined routes. The problem is that the catch-all route unintentionally overrides more specific routes, preventing them from being matched correctly.

The provided code shows a simple App component using React Router. The 'App.js' file shows the buggy implementation, and the 'AppSolution.js' demonstrates a corrected version.

## Bug Description:

The catch-all route (`<Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />`) always triggers, regardless of the URL. This prevents the other routes from working as expected. 

## Solution:

The solution involves carefully considering the order and placement of routes. The catch-all route should be placed *last* within the `Routes` component to ensure that it only handles URLs that don't match any other routes.

## How to Reproduce:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Notice that navigating to `/` or `/about` will still display 'Not Found'.

## Solved Version:

By moving the catch-all route to the end of the `Routes` definition, this issue is resolved, and navigating to `/` and `/about` will display the correct content.
